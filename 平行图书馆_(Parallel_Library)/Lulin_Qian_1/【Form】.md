Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

The reason why I particularly wanted to join this project was because it perfectly aligned with the

idea I have always believed in: that is, to make our environment and society better in a smarter and

warmer way. Before, I had learned about sustainable design cases in class and also participated in

community-building activities through volunteer work. But this project was the first time that I saw

discarded building wood could be transformed into bookshelves that children could reach out to

touch, and into desks and chairs where people could sit down and communicate. This is not just

about recycling; it's about redefining the value of discarded with creativity and kindness. |As a

student, I may not have much industry experience yet, but I have my own perspective and

enthusiasm. I have always been interested in how design can solve problems and how activities can

connect people. I have also tried to plan content and design experiences in course group projects

and club activities. This project is an opportunity to turn ideas into reality. For instance, could I

work with the team to design workshop for the local community in Kunshan? Or, could we plan a

series of theme sharing sessions about circular economy based on the campus environment? I

hope not only to learn, but also to actively participate. I want this project to have more fresh

possibilities because of the involvement of young people. |Finally, I believe that what makes it most

touching for me is that it is not merely an object, but rather creates a warm and story-filled public

space. In this increasingly digital era, a space that allows people to sit down and have face-to-face

communication, touch the temperature of the materials, and feel the shared knowledge is

particularly precious. I am looking forward to becoming a part of it, together with JLL's mentors and

partners, and injecting more vitality and imagination into such a space.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

As a student majoring in Computer Science, I have always been passionate about how to solve

practical problems from a cross-disciplinary perspective. In terms of community service, I have

participated in and organized various campus and local volunteer activities many times, such as

conducting awareness-raising classes on disability issues among primary school students and

providing translation and explanation of traditional Chinese medicine culture for foreign guests.

These experiences not only honed my ability to plan activities and coordinate on-site, but also

taught me how to convert complex concepts into language and experiences that are easy for

different audiences to understand. |In terms of project execution and team collaboration, I served

as the class monitor and the project leader for the student council interview program. I also took on

collaborative tasks in multiple team competitions and technical projects. These roles enabled me to

accumulate experience in managing the entire process from planning to implementation, and

allowed me to remain calm under pressure and efficiently advance tasks. I believe this level of

execution ability will help me effectively implement aspects such as workshop design and activity

plans when collaborating with the JLL team. |Furthermore, my technical background enables me to

quickly understand the process logic.I have also developed an interest in sustainable issues and

systemic impacts through experiences such as panda ecological research and editing content for

global health podcasts. I am eager to combine my data analysis skills, innovative mindset, and

passion for community service in this project, to inject a youthful and practical innovative

perspective into this project.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

First of all, I think we can make the core content of the project morebshareable. For instance, I can

work with the team members to compile the waste recyclingbprocess and our past workshop

experiences into a visually rich manual or a series of short videos. This way, when we go to schools

or communities, everyone can quickly get started, and more students can join in, forming a

""parallel library group"" within the campus, continuously injecting new ideas into the project.

|Secondly, I would like to try to involve more local partners in the project connection. I have

participated in many campus and local events in Kunshan, and have also met some club and

community workers. I can take the initiative to contact them and see if we can bring this into the

extracurricular classes of primary and secondary schools, or collaborate with local coffee shops

and cultural and creative spaces to hold small exhibitions and sharing sessions. Perhaps we can

also assist in designing some simple experiential activities and invite enterprise employees to

participate, so that the project can gradually establish its own support network. |Finally, I believe

that documenting and sharing are particularly important. After each activity, I will actively collect

the feedback and stories from the participants, and record them through photos, videos or words. I

will then share them on the school's official website or social media. This not only allows everyone

to see the progress and warmth of the project, but also attracts more people who are interested to

join. I believe that as long as more people can see, experience and be willing to participate, this

project will be able to grow its own vitality and continue indefinitely.
