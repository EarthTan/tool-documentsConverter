Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I'm interested in this project because it turns a theory I care about into something real. In my

studies, I look at big problems like pollution and inequality. The ""Parallel Library"" takes the idea of

a circular economy (using waste to create new value) and makes it physical. It turns scrap wood

from construction into bookshelves for a community that needs them. That direct link between an

environmental action (reducing waste) and a social good (building a learning space) is powerful to

me. My own research has shown me how important things like clean water and safe spaces are for

a community's health and future. This project builds that kind of necessity, but through creativity

and design instead of just pointing out a problem. I want to be part of making those solutions, not

just writing about the issues. I'm excited by the chance to work with JLL's professionals to help

design the workshops and activities that go with these spaces. I think my experience in research

and working across different cultures can help make sure what we create actually fits the people

and place it's meant for.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experience comes from trying to understand problems from the community's point of view. For

my policy report, I didn't just collect data about a water crisis; I looked at local news, read what

people were saying online, and figured out how the problem was affecting their daily lives (their

health, their jobs, their trust in officials). To be a good leader, you first have to be a good listener.

My skill is in taking complicated information (like scientific data or government policies) and making

it clear and useful for the people who are affected by it. I did this by writing recommendations for

advocacy groups, telling them exactly where to apply pressure to create change. In high school, I

was team leader of local club, which was teaching English language to kids with special needs. |For

a project like the Parallel Library, these skills mean I can help our team listen to what a community

really wants from the space. I can help us talk to local teachers or parents, understand their needs,

and then translate our creative ideas into plans that make sense for them. I believe leadership in a

community project is about connecting the team's vision with the community's voice to build

something together.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

To make sure the Parallel Library lasts, we need to make sure the community feels it belongs to

them, not just to us or to JLL. My plan would focus on handing over the tools and the confidence to

let it grow on its own. First, during the initial workshops we design, we wouldn't just run them. We'd

identify a few keen local participants (maybe a teacher, a librarian, or a parent) and train them to

run future workshops themselves. We'd make them ""Keepers"" of the library. This builds local

capacity from the start. It is also about community empowerment and bringing all of its members

together. |So, we should avoid creating complicated, perfect programs that only we can manage.

Instead, I'd focus on helping create simple, flexible ""activity kits."" Think of a box with a few

prompts, simple instructions, and basic materials for a storytelling hour or a craft project using

recycled materials. These kits would live at the library. Anyone, even a new volunteer, could pick

one up and run an activity. This makes the library active even when our core team isn't

there.|Finally, we could connect different Parallel Library sites in a simple network. A shared

WeChat group or a basic online document where different volunteers/team members can share

what activity worked well, what didn't, and ask each other for advice. This turns it from a single

project into a living community of practice that can sustain itself and adapt.
