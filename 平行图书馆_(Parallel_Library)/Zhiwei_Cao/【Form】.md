Intended major: Economic

Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

It is mainly divided into two parts. | | Firstly, I have a strong interest in economics and sustainable

development. Besides systematically learning relevant theoretical knowledge in class, I have also

accumulated solid knowledge reserves by reading cutting-edge academic papers and following

industry dynamic reports. I sincerely hope to deeply integrate theoretical knowledge with practical

applications through this project, further improve my professional economic skills, and gain

valuable first-hand practical experience. | | Meanwhile, I also have a wealth of personal experiences

and profound insights regarding resource utilization and public welfare projects. The public welfare

activities I participated in the past made me truly realize the importance of rational resource

allocation. Therefore, I look forward to taking this opportunity to continue spreading kindness and

warmth, and use my own knowledge and abilities to integrate resources more efficiently, so as to

contribute my share to the public welfare undertakings related to sustainable development.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

At Duke Kunshan University, I serve as the president of the Figure Skating Club. I have rich

experience in leading my fellow students to manage the club, organize various activities, and

coordinate personnel in all aspects. I have learned that when leading a team or a group, we should

take the needs of all parties into consideration as much as possible. When resolving conflicts, the

best way is for everyone to communicate and discuss face-to-face, rather than engaging in a cold

war or evading the problem. Teamwork is never about one-sided compromise, but about finding a

balance that takes into account the interests of all parties after fully listening to different voices. As

a team leader, it is even more important to take the initiative to build a bridge of communication,

coordinate differences with an inclusive attitude, and thus gather genuine team cohesion.| | During

my senior high school years, I worked as the vice-captain of the synchronized skating team at

Beijing Tidi Bright Skating Club. Thus, I have a clear understanding of the essentials of teamwork

and possess ample experience related to leadership. | | Meanwhile, I am also a member of the

Houlang Charity of our school. When I participated in the volunteer teaching program in Yuanling

County, Hunan Province last year, I acquired a great many skills in leading peers and

communicating with multiple stakeholders, and also accumulated a wealth of experience in

community services.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

For this long-term project with both public welfare and educational attributes, I will dedicate

sufficient time and energy to ensure the sustainability and stability of its progress. I will break down

the overall tasks in a refined way: first setting core monthly goals, then subdividing them into

weekly plans, and finally translating them into specific daily actionable items. This layered

decomposition approach will guarantee efficient advancement. || In terms of collaboration, I will

actively communicate and coordinate with the project leader and managers, consulting and

providing feedback promptly whenever issues arise. Meanwhile, with a respectful and modest

attitude, I will boldly put forward my innovative ideas and suggestions, offering constructive input

for the project's development and helping the team achieve its goals.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

This is a more detailed plan:|| For the Parallel Library project, I will break down tasks into monthly

goals, weekly plans and daily to-dos: in the early stage, I will participate in sustainable design and

course co-creation, develop audience-specific courses, workshops and educational toolkits, and

turn circular economy and design thinking into practical content. || In the middle stage, I will focus

on community activity and space planning, design a series of cultural and educational activities,

and explore feasible plans for integrating this model into Kunshan's local communities and campus

scenarios. || In collaboration, I will actively communicate with project leaders, promptly report

issues and seek advice, and put forward innovative and feasible ideas based on the needs of

course development and scenario integration. || These are just my initial thoughts based on the

project overview; going forward, I will keep in-depth communication and consultation with the team

and project management to finalize an innovative and implementable plan.
