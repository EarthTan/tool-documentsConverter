Zhiwei Cao✔Personal profileRelevant experiencesNAMEDuke Kunshan University曹知微VivianClass of 2029, Freshman,18 years oldHometown: BeijingPhone number: 15910506156Email: zc275@duke.eduWechat: Vivianyy070506Hello everyone! My name is Zhiwei Cao. I'mfrom Beijing and I'm 18 years old.I am a freshman student at DKU. I think mypersonality can be divided into two parts. Ienjoy being alone, delving into the topics I aminterested in by myself, and relishing the joyof inspiration and innovative exploration. ButI also like interacting with others, learning insocial settings, and progressing throughcollaboration.I am a national-level figure skating athlete.Since childhood, I have been practicing figureskating, which has cultivated in me a strongwillpower. I always have the courage anddetermination to overcome difficulties. When I entered university, I established thefigure skating club at Duke KunshanUniversity and served as the president. Theclub started from scratch and now organizesregular outings every week, achievingsignificant results. My organizational skills for the team and theability to collaborate with others have beencultivated unconsciously. I discovered that Ienjoy contributing my efforts and proposingmy ideas. This exploration andexperimentation have greatly enhanced myunderstanding of event planning and teamcooperation.When I was in primary school, by chance, my parents and Iwent to the Chaka Salt Lake area in Qinghai. There, Iexchanged school supplies with the local children. For the firsttime, I realized that those insignificant objects in my eyes wereactually priceless treasures in their hearts. Their appreciationfor any resources, their curiosity and desire to explore theurban lifestyle in big cities, have remained with me to this dayand are unforgettable. Perhaps it was from that time that Ihoped to have the opportunity to truly participate in activitiesthat would enable the children there to learn about the outsideworld.The first time I came into contact with children from ethnic minority areas, the seeds ofcharity began to sprout.Participate in educational charity projects and disseminate knowledge andkindnessI firmly wanted to seek opportunities and use my knowledgeto create more usable value for society, to ensure bettercirculation of resources. I also hoped to have the chance tomake those in need of help happier with my humble efforts.Therefore, joining the CSR project of JLL became one of mymajor desires. I have the responsibility and confidence tocontribute my strength to the project by leveraging my liberalarts background and my experience in educational publicwelfare.Studied economics in high school and the concept of sustainable developmentwas further deepened.Last semester, I joined the Houlang Charity Club at Duke Kunshan University. Last year, I came toYuanling, Hunan Province to carry out public welfare activities. I went to Yuanling No.1 HighSchool and shared my high school study experiences and insights with the students. From thelecture sessions to one-on-one conversations, from school visits to home visits, I became moredeeply aware of the inequality in resource distribution and saw those in need of help. During my six years in middle school, I always chose to take thepolitical subject as an elective. This semester, I am studyingECON101 and PPE202 (political, philosophy, economic) courses.I have developed a strong interest and profound understanding ofeconomics and the concept of sustainable development. When Iwas in grade 10, due to my excellent performance in politics, I wasselected as a member of the school's political interest group. Underthe guidance of the teacher, we would discuss a current economichot topic every week. My economic thinking skill was thus welldeveloped and improved.
