Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

My desire to join this project stems from a deep-seated belief that sustainable community

transformation requires long-term commitment and a human-centered approach. My field

observations in integrated care communities across Taiwan and mainland China revealed a critical

insight: the most successful programs were those built on sustained relationships and adaptive co-

creation, not short-term interventions. This project's extended timeline resonates precisely with

that learning.||At Duke Kunshan, my outreach work taught me that genuine engagement means

listening first-whether to prospective students from diverse backgrounds or elderly residents

sharing life stories. The digital media campaigns I led, which garnered over 5,000 engagements,

further showed me how sustained narrative-building fosters belonging. This project offers the rare

opportunity to move beyond temporary involvement and contribute to a living ecosystem of

change. I am drawn not just to ""do"" but to ""grow with""-to apply my skills in empathetic

communication and visual storytelling across seasons of a community's life, helping to weave a

tapestry of inclusion that lasts.|

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experiences have equipped me with a unique blend of relational, observational, and creative

skills essential for community leadership. Volunteering at senior care centers honed my ability to

practice patience and empathy across generations-not as sympathy, but as active listening that

validates each voice. This translates directly to inclusive leadership: creating spaces where diverse

members feel heard and valued.||As a field researcher in cross-strait care communities, I learned to

observe systemic interactions-how physical space, social programming, and emotional care

intertwine. This systems-thinking allows me to see both the individual stories and the broader

patterns, a crucial perspective for guiding community initiatives. Furthermore, my digital media

work demonstrates an ability to communicate a shared vision compellingly. Leading isn't just about

managing tasks; it's about fostering a shared identity. By combining empathetic bridge-building,

strategic observation, and narrative-building skills, I can help unite members around a common

purpose and navigate the complex, human dynamics at the heart of any community endeavor.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

For a project to thrive across years, it must evolve from being project-based to community-owned.

My long-term sustainability plan focuses on three pillars: embedded legacy, adaptive learning, and

distributed leadership.||First, I would prioritize embedding skills and roles within the community

itself. Rather than centralizing tasks, I'd advocate for mentoring local members in coordination,

documentation (using my media skills to create simple guides), and facilitation. This builds

institutional memory that outlasts any single participant.||Second, I'd institute a lightweight, regular

feedback loop-perhaps quarterly ""community reflection"" sessions-to collectively assess what's

working and adapt. My field research taught me that models must locally fit; a rigid plan will fail. We

must stay responsive to changing needs.||Finally, cultivating a rotating leadership bench is key. By

inviting different members to co-lead smaller initiatives, we nurture a sense of shared investment

and prepare natural successors. This approach ensures the project remains vibrant, responsive,

and deeply rooted, transforming it from an external program into a self-sustaining community

asset.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

My strength in collaborative partnership stems from a mindset of supportive followership. In

university outreach, I successfully partnered with admissions leaders by proactively aligning my

efforts with their strategic goals, communicating clearly, and anticipating needs-whether it was

preparing materials for an event or debriefing insights from families. I believe in making my leader's

work easier through reliability, initiative, and positive reinforcement.||Regarding leadership

transition, my experience in various team settings has taught me that adaptability is rooted in

respect for the project's continuity over any individual's role. When change occurs, I focus first on

listening and learning the new leader's vision and working style. My interpersonal approach-being

approachable, asking clarifying questions, and demonstrating consistent commitment to the

project's core mission-helps build trust quickly. I see leadership changes not as disruptions, but as

opportunities to integrate fresh perspectives, ensuring my support remains a constant, stabilizing

force for the project's enduring success.
