Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I am interested in this project because it combines community-centered design, social innovation,

and real public impact, which aligns with my academic interests and service experiences. The

opportunity to rethink and redesign public spaces in Shaocun Community resonates with my belief

that environment plays an important role in shaping people's sense of belonging and well-being.

Instead of treating public space as purely functional, this project recognizes it as a shared cultural

and social asset, which I find really meaningful.||What I like the most is the project's emphasis on

moving beyond conceptual proposals to real-world implementation. The idea of adopting a

""curator"" mindset by listening to residents, understanding local culture, and translating those

insights into creative and practical designs really reflects the type of socially responsible design

work I hope to pursue. As a Materials Science student with a strong interest in design, I am drawn

to how aesthetics, material choices, and spatial planning can come together to improve everyday

experiences.||Additionally, the project's focus on collaboration between students, community staff,

and residents aligns with my past experiences in community service and team-work initiatives. I

value projects that prioritize dialogue and long-term engagement rather than one-time

interventions. Being able to witness the visible transformation of a neighborhood and know that it

reflects collective effort and community needs is deeply motivating to me. Overall, this project

represents an ideal crossing of creativity, social responsibility, and hands-on learning.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experiences in leadership, design, and community service have prepared me to contribute as a

skilled and reliable community leader in this project. I have extensively worked in collaborative,

people-centered environments, where success depends on communication, empathy, and

coordination. As a retreat leader, I guided diverse groups through team-building activities and

helped design shared spaces and experiences that encouraged participation and trust. This role

strengthened my ability to facilitate group dynamics while remaining attentive to individual voices.||I

have also served as an international student leader and ambassador, supporting students from

different cultural backgrounds through tutoring and cultural integration. This experience enhanced

my cross-cultural communication skills and taught me how to adapt ideas and leadership styles to

different contexts. In addition, my volunteer work designing educational posters and activities for

WWF Italia helped me learn how to translate abstract concepts into accessible, visually engaging

formats for the public.||Working as a kindergarten teacher's assistant further reinforced the

importance of patience, responsibility, and inclusive design. Planning activities and supporting

children with diverse needs taught me to lead with empathy and adaptability, qualities I believe to

be very important when engaging with residents of different ages and backgrounds.||I am

comfortable working within teams, organizing tasks, listening to feedback, and contributing

creatively while keeping community needs at the center.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

To support the long-term development of this project, I would focus on creating systems and

relationships that allow the community to continue benefiting beyond the initial implementation

phase. One key approach would be co-creating solutions with residents and community staff rather

than designing for them. By involving residents in the planning, execution, and evaluation of public

space enhancements and art programs, the project can foster a sense of responsibility that

encourages long-term care and engagement.||I would also prioritize sustainable operational models

for both space management and programming. This could include developing clear guidelines for

maintaining installations, documenting processes for organizing art education activities, and

training local volunteers or community members to lead future programs. ||Another important

element is continuous feedback. Regular check-ins with community partners, residents, and

volunteers can help see what is working, what needs to be improved, and how community needs

may change. This feedback-driven approach ensures that the project remains responsive.
