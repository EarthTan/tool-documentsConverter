Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

As a girl born and raised in Henan Province, I have a deep appreciation for Chinese culture,

especially its rich heritage, classical literature, traditional attire, music, and various forms of art.

Among the many regional cultures that contribute to China's vibrant cultural landscape, Suzhou

culture stands out as an essential and influential part. After enrolling at DKU, I have had the

opportunity to explore Suzhou culture more closely-its history, aesthetics, and artistic traditions-

and this experience has greatly deepened my understanding of its value. It has also inspired me to

recognize the importance of preserving and promoting Suzhou culture as a vital component of our

shared cultural identity.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

I have participated in the ESL (English as a Second Language) program in the Philippines before,

which greatly improved my skills of culture learning and communicating. And having studied and

lived in an environment rich in cultural exchange at DKU, I have learned how to engage diverse

communities with respect and curiosity. Through my academic and extracurricular involvement, I

have organized cultural events, facilitated group discussions, and coordinated teamwork across

different backgrounds-all of which strengthened my communication, collaboration, and

organizational skills. In particular, my growing interest in Suzhou culture has motivated me to take

initiative in promoting traditional art forms, such as classical music, embroidery, and architecture,

to my peers. I approach community leadership with empathy and inclusivity, ensuring everyone

feels valued and inspired to contribute. I believe that a good community leader not only shares

knowledge but also builds a sense of pride and belonging, and I am eager to bring these qualities to

the Suzhou culture promotion project.
