Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I am a local of Suzhou and I also hope to find opportunities to promote our culture. Suzhou, as a

representative area of Jiangnan water towns, is a place with many cultures. However, over time,

many of them have become unknown, and even I myself do not know all of these special cultures.

Therefore, I hope to continue our culture and enable everyone to understand the culture of Suzhou

through various means. At the same time, I believe that I am good at communicating with others

and enjoy interacting with them. This will help me collaborate with others in building cultural

communities, solve problems more effectively, and gain valuable experiences through

communication with the community.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

I have an outgoing personality and am good at listening and expressing myself. I am able to

efficiently coordinate the ideas of team members and work together to promote the implementation

of projects. At the same time, I am passionate about volunteering and have participated in local

volunteer service activities multiple times, helping residents and accumulating rich practical

experience through dedication. At the same time, I have a certain understanding of the culture of

this region and have also heard some explanations related to Suzhou culture, which gives me a

certain understanding of the planning and execution of related cultural projects.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

I plan to spread Suzhou culture through a dual platform of online and offline means: offline, relying

on volunteer service experience, entering gardens and intangible cultural heritage sites, and

conducting immersive explanations and skill experience activities; We can try to create a cultural

dissemination platform online, using short videos and other forms to break down cultural

connotations, and linking current trend IP and digital technology innovation expression; At the same

time, leveraging the Suzhou Overseas Cultural Exchange Platform, we aim to promote the

development of Suzhou style culture on a broader stage.
