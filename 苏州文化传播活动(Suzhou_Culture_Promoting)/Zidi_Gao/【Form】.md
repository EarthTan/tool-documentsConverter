Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I have lived in Suzhou since I was 2 years old. During my life in Suzhou, I have visited Suzhou

gardens, museums, moats, and other places with Suzhou's historical characteristics many times. I

have a deep appreciation for Suzhou's culture and am relatively well acquainted with the history of

Suzhou's ancient urban areas, such as Shantang Street, Pingjiang Road, and its classical gardens.

After visiting the Suzhou Garden Museum and learning about the Xiangshan School of craftsmen, I

came to realize that the architectural layout and landscape design of Suzhou gardens embody not

only a distinctly Chinese aesthetic but also the underlying logic of traditional Chinese culture, such

as the ideas of ""the unity of heaven and humanity"" and ""adapting to the natural flow.""|I hope to

introduce Suzhou-and even Chinese culture as a whole-to international audiences by focusing on

aspects that are often overlooked, such as garden design and residential layout, so that within the

setting of classical gardens, they may experience a deeper, spiritual resonance with authentic

Chinese culture.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

I have built a handicraft-making club in my high school and successfully held an exhibition by

leading the whole club for one year. Besides, I gathered a small group of people last semester to

participate in the DII program and came up with a proposal, which got a chance to make a pitch. |I

think my leadership advantage is that I can break down the whole task into small pieces and make

all procedures in strong logic. Also, I am good at build framework for the whole team to make sure

everyone has their special role in the group. Besides, I know how to list the procedures while

working on a long-term project. If I can lead a group of people, I will give them clear tasks, making

the progress of the work process clearly visible and ensuring that the work progress can be

measured.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

Even though the project I applied for is just a short-term project, I still want to list my plan here:|1-

My groupmates and I should be familiar with the knowledge related to the Suzhou gardens and how

to make a podcast.|2- An overall plan for the content of the podcast should be made. (plan to go to

a different garden in a different episode)|3- For every series, first, we should go to the garden after

getting familiar with the knowledge we can learn from books; then we should write the scripts. To

have a deeper understanding of the gardens, I know where and who we can ask for professional

academic advice and tour guidance.|4- Record and make the podcast.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

Short term (within 4 months):|The project will focus on building a stable foundation. This includes

establishing a clear podcast framework, producing several completed episodes on different Suzhou

gardens (3 to 5), and standardizing research, scripting, and recording procedures. (At the same

time, we will form connections with garden institutions, museums, and academic advisors to ensure

content accuracy and continuity.)|Long term (beyond 4 months):|The project can be evolved into

more sustainable cultural platforms. New team members can join by following the established

production model, allowing continuous content expansion. The accumulated episodes will form a

long-term archive on Suzhou gardens, and the project may further develop into bilingual

educational resources or cross-media formats, extending its academic and cultural impact to a

broader international audience.
