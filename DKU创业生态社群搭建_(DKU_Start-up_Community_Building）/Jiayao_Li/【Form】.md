Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I'm interested in S-tron's project for two main reasons. First, its positioning of ""student

ambassadors as a bridge between universities and enterprises"" allows me to further develop my

cross-organizational communication, teamwork and leadership skills within a more professional

tech innovation ecosystem. Second, as a well-known Asian tech innovation platform, S-tron's

activities like Tech Trek and startup roadshows give me access to real entrepreneurial resources

and corporate needs-this not only sparks my interest in ""university-enterprise linkage"" but also

helps me better understand the practical operation logic of the tech innovation field, laying core

experience for future work in university-enterprise collaboration

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

I see my community leadership reflected in resource linkage and problem-solving:|As the lead of

alumni return campus promotion event, I proactively engaged with high school leaders and DKU

Admissions Office, coordinating resources and adjusting the event workflow to ensure the talk

launched successfully. It built my cross-organizational communication and resource integration

skills.|Second, I can identify issues and drive multi-party collaboration. When I noticed flawed

training arrangements for the DKU badminton varsity, I connected the university's sports

department and coach, facilitating multiple discussions to optimize the training plan. I believe that

these experiences have equipped me with some core community leadership skills.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

For this long-term project, I have two plans to sustain its progress right now.|First, I will organize S-

tron's DKU activities (such as lectures and Tech Trek, etc)by clarifying their schedules and

execution procedures. This structured framework will make it easier to coordinate timelines in

advance for future initiatives.|Second, I will regularly update S-tron's project lead on campus

needs, while using channels like the DKU student ambassador group to share information and

resolve issues promptly.|These steps will not only ensure the steady implementation of the project

but also help stabilize the collaborative ecosystem between the university and the enterprise.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

In addition to the two points mentioned earlier, I will focus on the following two aspects to promote

the long-term development of the project: First, when coordinating with the project leader,

prioritize information alignment. Keep the leader updated on key matters such as event schedules,

and feedback on event outcomes to facilitate program optimization and enhance implementability.

Second, If there is a change of leadership, promptly compile project progress and resource lists,

and complete the handover with the new ambassador to maintain an uninterrupted project pace.

These measures will more effectively guarantee the long-term and stable implementation of the

project.
