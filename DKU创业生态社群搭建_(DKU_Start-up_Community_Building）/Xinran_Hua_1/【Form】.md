Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

This project emphasizes connecting DKU students with S-Tron China's projects, activities, and

resources. By participating as a bridge between the university, industry, and innovation platforms,

the project aligns closely with DKU's educational philosophy of cultivating ""bridge builders.""

Through involvement in activities such as event support, entrepreneurship promotion, community

operations, and cross-organizational collaboration, I would be able to further develop my

leadership, project management, and external communication skills.|For me, this type of hands-on

experience is highly valuable regardless of whether I pursue a career in industry, entrepreneurship,

or innovation-related fields, and it represents an important opportunity for personal learning and

growth. In addition, as one of the most influential technology innovation platforms in Asia, S-Tron

China offers extensive entrepreneurial resources and experience in organizing innovation activities.

Through this project, I hope to gain first-hand insight into how innovation platforms operate and

learn how they support the growth of early-stage entrepreneurs and innovative projects.|

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

First, since high school, I have served as the Head of the Discipline Inspection Department of the

Student Union as well as the class monitor. During this period, I worked closely with other core

members of the Student Union to organize two Student Representative Congresses for the entire

secondary school division, including both middle and high school. I also participated in organizing

two Leica Student Summits, where I was responsible for planning, coordinating task allocations

across departments, and serving as a speaker to present summaries of our work and future plans.

In addition, I was involved in organizing two campus cultural and arts festival galas, two school-

wide New Year celebrations, and the secondary school sports meeting.|Second, in my role as class

monitor, in addition to organizing regular class meetings, I served as both director and scriptwriter

for two class drama performances during the campus cultural and arts festivals. In these activities,

I was responsible for event planning, task delegation, and coordination, leading the team to

efficiently advance the progress of the projects.|After entering university, I participated in the

Digital Innovation Challenge program. Identified critical inefficiencies across the molecular

pharmaceutical pipeline (literature review, intervention pathway design, feasibility assessment,

clinical trials, and commercialization), where fragmentation leads to high costs and low

optimization efficiency. Develop an integrated medical support artificial intelligence system

encompassing research and development, marketing, and clinical applications, as well as

completed initial AI integration, industry analysis, and strategic proposal in collaboration with team

members.|

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

By serving as a bridge between DKU and S-Tron, I will assist in advancing collaborative projects

and activities between the two parties. This includes supporting the planning and execution of on-

campus events such as entrepreneur meetups and lectures (e.g., Collide Lab). At the same time, I

will systematically document event workflows, external communication practices, partnership

resources, and execution experiences to help future student participants quickly adapt and ensure

continuity in project operations.|In addition, I will gradually deepen my understanding of how

innovation platforms operate and how entrepreneurial ecosystems function. I plan to bring these

insights back to campus and share them with the student community, thereby strengthening the

project's visibility, impact, and sense of recognition within DKU.|
