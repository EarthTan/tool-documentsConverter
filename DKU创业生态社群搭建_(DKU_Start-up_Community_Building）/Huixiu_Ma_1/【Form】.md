Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

My interest in this project stems from my aspirations to explore finance and innovation &

entrepreneurship, paired with a desire to gain practical experience in university-enterprise

collaboration. As a renowned Asian tech innovation platform, S-Tron's ability to connect global

resources, tech enterprises, and investors-through events like TechTrek, monthly roadshows, and

annual conferences-offers an invaluable window to observe how innovation intersects with

business and investment, aligning perfectly with my career exploration goals.|Additionally, the

student ambassador role allows me to apply my existing skills. My experience in club event

planning, WeChat Official Account operation, and Xiaohongshu marketing has honed my community

linkage, cross-team communication, and activity execution abilities-all essential for bridging DKU

and S-Tron, and supporting joint programs.|I am eager to leverage this opportunity to learn from S-

Tron's corporate mentors, deepen my understanding of innovation ecosystem operations, and

enhance my leadership and project management skills. This practice will lay a solid foundation for

my future pursuits in finance and entrepreneurship.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experiences in community coordination, cross-party communication, and activity execution

equip me to be a strong community leader. As an Event Coordinator for REACH Club, I led a

volunteer-focused project, designing training programs, streamlining administrative workflows, and

ensuring smooth distribution of support. I also curated inclusive activities that fostered cross-

cultural understanding and strengthened community cohesion.|In the Travel Club, I served as a

content and event planner, creating relatable WeChat Official Account content to document

activities and member experiences, deepening community bonds. I collaborated in refining event

plans through team discussions, focusing on participant needs and logistics.|During the U-Corp ×

DREAME co-branding project, I handled Xiaohongshu marketing tasks, creating diverse content to

promote a smart ring. I participated in regular internal meetings and aligned with DREAME's contact

persons, sharing campaign progress and adjusting strategies collaboratively based on feedback.

This honed my collaborative problem-solving and communication skills.|Proficient in bilingual

communication (Mandarin native, English proficient) and tools like PPT and CapCut, I excel at

bridging gaps, organizing resources, and driving engagement-key strengths for linking DKU and S-

Tron as a student ambassador.|

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

To sustain the project's long-term development, I focus on smooth handover, resource connection,

and active community-following the requirement to elect and hand over to a new ambassador

before May and matching S-Tron's innovation goals.|First, make knowledge transfer clear. I will

create a detailed guide that includes how to run activities, S-Tron's contact details, and good ways

to organize on-campus events like Collide Lab lectures. I will find potential new ambassadors early

and let them follow me to learn the work, so the handover goes well before May.|Second,

strengthen links between the university and S-Tron-benefiting both sides. I will list S-Tron's

resources (events like TechTrek and monthly roadshows, mentors, networks) and DKU students'

interests (entrepreneurship, finance). I will talk to S-Tron regularly to get event updates and share

students' needs. For S-Tron, I can suggest promoting its events to DKU's active student

community, helping attract young talent and expand its campus influence. For students, I will

connect them with S-Tron's resources that match their interests, ensuring the cooperation brings

value to both parties.|Third, keep students interested. I will use WeChat and DKU's internal

platforms to share project news, innovation stories, and what the ambassador does. I will organize

small exchange meetings with S-Tron's mentors to build a group of students who care about

entrepreneurship-so the project's influence lasts beyond the initial period.
