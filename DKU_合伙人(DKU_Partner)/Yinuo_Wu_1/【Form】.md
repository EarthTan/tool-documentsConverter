Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I am highly interested in this project because it perfectly aligns with my background in psychology,

my passion for teaching, and my deep commitment to educational equity. Through my practical

experience in psychological counseling and project leadership, I have developed strong skills in

communication, team facilitation, and educational program design. I hope to apply my knowledge of

psychology to support student development in county-level educational settings and promote

sustainable educational practices through social innovation. In the long term, I aspire to become an

educator who integrates humanistic care with actionable impact, and PEER's project represents a

meaningful platform to realize this goal.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

Based on my experience as project leader for the Starbucks animal protection initiative and my role

as a psychological counselor, I have developed strong skills in team coordination, empathetic

communication, and structured guidance. I excel at bridging organizational goals with community

needs, mentoring individuals, and mobilizing group participation-all essential for leading

educational and volunteer-based projects like PEER's.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

My long-term sustainability plan centers on system-building, collaborative ownership, and smooth

transition. I will create clear volunteer guidelines and training tools to ensure continuity beyond

individual involvement. I will engage students and DKU volunteers in co-designing activities to

foster local ownership and maintain motivation. To collaborate effectively with the project leader, I

will establish regular communication and shared task tracking. For leadership transitions, I will

prepare structured handover materials and ensure overlap periods between leaders to maintain

momentum and knowledge transfer. This approach aims to embed the project into the community

and support its ongoing growth.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

To ensure the long-term sustainability and continuous impact of this project, I will focus on building

a resilient operational system and a collaborative ecosystem. First, I will systematically document

project processes, resource tools, and key learnings to establish a replicable and iterative

framework, preventing disruptions due to staff turnover. At the same time, I will actively involve

local student teams and DKU volunteers in the design and implementation of activities, fostering a

sense of ownership and sustained motivation.|In collaborating with the project leader, I will maintain

regular communication and alignment on goals, while using shared collaboration tools to ensure

transparency and progress tracking. In the event of leadership transitions, I will prepare a

comprehensive handover document containing essential project information, partner contacts,

phase objectives, and pending tasks. I will also arrange overlapping work periods between

incoming and outgoing leaders to ensure smooth transition and knowledge continuity.|Ultimately,

through systematic planning, inclusive participation, and structured transitions, I aim to embed the

project deeply within the community, enabling it to become self-sustaining and continuously

evolving.
