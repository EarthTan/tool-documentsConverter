Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

The reason I am eager to participate in this project is because I have attended the Social Innovation

Project held by DKU in the summer break. During the workshop, we learnt about the NGO PEER,

which has successfully organized many activities like improving the mental health of students in

county-level middle schools. I was really impressed by how different the conditions were among

students in different areas. I was also touched by how PEER has changed those students' life by

having those activities. Most importantly, I came to realize how lucky I am as I grew up in a

relatively wealth city with supportive parents, something I do not naturally deserve. In fact, one of

the most important reasons I have been able to achieve what I have is my good luck, which has

made me reflect how I can use this good fortune to help others in relatively less fortunate

circumstances. I believe that this project can help more people in need use the resources in DKU

and also enable more DKUers to contribute to the society, just as the painting in DKU wall says:

""知识回报社会"".

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

I was the leader of the Social Innovation Project held by DKU. I cooperated well with all my

teammates and we did prototypes, brainstormed the solutions and made an interactive video about

sex education. I am good at facilitating people to come up with innovative ideas collectively using

my communication skills and I love how a team can overcome challenges that individuals can hardly

achieve.||I have participated in CTB as well, which requires students to work collectively on a

research topic. During that experience, I, along with my teammates, learnt how to make

questionnaires, have interviews and wrote academic papers. By doing so, I not only learnt academic

skills, but more importantly, I learnt how to complete a complex project with others jointly.

Additionally, I also gained experience on how to communicate with people at different ages and

backgrounds, which equipped me with capability of being a good community leader.||

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

To ensure sustainable development in the long-run, I have three rough approaches now. The first

one is to set clear periodic goals. The team needs to set up clear long-term goals like annual

phased goals. With the aim of reaching the long-term goals, the team can then split the these goals

into different phases and accomplish it phase by phase, such as monthly goals. The second

approach is to establish the outcome verification mechanism. The team can work collaboratively

with PEER and DKU Innovation and Entrepreneurship to verify the outcomes against the set goals.

The third approach is to establish a regularized progress tracking mechanism. For example, set up

weekly or biweekly meetings to sync up progress.||To cooperate effectively with the project leader,

I believe it is important to actively and promptly gather information from the project leader and

clarify the overall project requirements as well as available resources. Moreover, it is important to

submit written achievement reports to project leaders regularly to obtain feedback, and make

timely improvements.||To smoothen the process of leader transition, it is important to record

important information clearly and integrate data regularly. Additionally, the outgoing leader and the

incoming leader should hold a handover meeting to clarify the project goals, timeline, and the

team's current progress.
