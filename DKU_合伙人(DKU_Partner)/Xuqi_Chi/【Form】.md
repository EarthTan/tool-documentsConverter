Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

Since my father's hometown is a small village in the northen-east part of China, I get to know some

peers who may possess the talent, but didn't finish their school and choose another worse life

direction because of the poor education quality and cognitive limitation. That is where my initial

passion for education equity comes from. When I came to DKU, I entered DKU Youngsters

Engagement Club. During my visit to a county-level high school, I get to know more about their

growth environment and the challenges they are facing. So I consider this project as a good

opportunity to learn more about the current situation of county-level education in China and see if

there is more I can do to improve it. Also since we will build our own volunteer system and conduct

activities in this project, I want to enhance my leadership skills and implement them to conduct

more meaningful programmes in DKU Youngsters Engagement Club in the future.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

Firstly, I have experiences related to county education. I am a member of DKU Youngsters

Engagement Club which focuses on education equity, and I participated in the collaboration with

Honghui Miles Project. Last November, I visited to The First High School of Yuanling County,

Huaihua City in person, conducting a sharing presentation themed how to bridge the gap between

ourselves and the goals for Gaokao with my partner. I also had home visit and two-on-one

communication with the students, showing that I have strong communication skills. Additionally, I

was responsible for writing CSCC mid-term report of this project. Secondly, I have voluntary

experiences pf Beijing Mulan game theatre and BUY 42 one-day manager which require

communication and organization skills.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

Firstly, since the main project is conducted in county-level, I want to ensure a regular basis in-

person visit which will contribute to stronger connection with county-level schools. To achieve

continuous progress, I want to firstly build strong connection with other team members. There will

be online groupchat and offline meetings to foster a sense of belonging and shared mission. Also, I

will design a plan with clear time line at the beginning of the project to ensure the ongoing

operation of the project. There will be reflection after every activity to make timely adjustment.

Those experiences will contribute a lot to explore the replicability of the project. When it turns to

the collaboration with project leader, I will firstly clarify the way and frequency of communication

like weekly brief report and monthly online meeting. It is also important to distirbute different

missions. Shared working tools like google doc will be used efficiently. If there is leader transition,

he or she needs to be familiar with our previous work and is supported by all the project members.
