Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I'm deeply drawn to this project because it aligns with my desire to drive tangible, visible change in

the community and build genuine connections with its residents-moving beyond theoretical ideas

to real-world impact.|The University Park Community's mission to create a connected, inclusive

space for diverse groups resonates with me, as I believe communities thrive when every member

feels valued and engaged. Unlike abstract initiatives, this project offers a rare chance to turn

creative ideas into actionable solutions-whether through digital tools that enhance governance or

activities that foster integration. I'm eager to leverage my experience in event planning, content

creation, and cross-group communication to design initiatives that directly address residents'

needs, from resource-sharing platforms to community-building activities.|Moreover, I crave

authentic connections with the community. Collaborating with residents, researchers, and local

partners will let me understand their unique challenges firsthand, ensuring the solutions I help

develop are practical and meaningful. This project isn't just about completing tasks; it's about co-

creating a better living environment and building lasting bonds. I'm excited to contribute my skills,

learn from the community, and witness the positive, visible changes that come from genuine

collaboration.|

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experience in community building, inclusive activity design, and cross-group collaboration

equips me to be an effective community leader. As an Event Coordinator for REACH Club, I led

volunteer-focused projects, designing training programs and streamlining administrative processes

to ensure smooth execution. I also curated diversity-driven activities that fostered cross-cultural

understanding, strengthening connections among participants from different backgrounds.|In the

Travel Club, I served as a content and event planner, creating relatable content for the WeChat

Official Account to document activities and share experiences. This work deepened emotional

bonds within the community and boosted engagement. I collaborated with team members to refine

event plans, focusing on participant needs and logistics to deliver enjoyable, well-organized

experiences.|Additionally, my experience in digital content creation (Xiaohongshu, CapCut) and

basic data skills (R, applied statistics) allows me to support community digital innovation-such as

developing resource-sharing platforms or engaging online content. Proficient in bilingual

communication (Mandarin native, English proficient), I excel at listening to diverse voices,

coordinating resources, and turning ideas into actionable plans. My commitment to inclusive,

practical change aligns with the project's goal of building a connected community.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

To sustain the project long-term, I've designed three practical, actionable steps focused on

resident engagement, institutionalized operations, and seamless succession:|First, build a simple

feedback mechanism. After launching each activity or digital tool (e.g., a resource-sharing mini-

program), I'll distribute short paper or online surveys (via WeChat) to collect resident opinions-

focusing on usability and relevance. I'll also host quarterly small-group talks with 5-8 residents

(including students, seniors, and expats) to identify pain points, then adjust initiatives accordingly

(e.g., simplifying a tool's interface or adding multilingual support for events).|Second, formalize

daily operations with a ""community co-construction manual."" It will detail step-by-step workflows

for common tasks: booking community venues, coordinating with Chenguang Foundation for

activity materials, and updating DKU mentors on progress. I'll also create a shared digital folder

(e.g., WeChat Work) to store activity photos, feedback summaries, and contact lists (including Hao

Xu and foundation partners) for easy access.|Third, establish a student succession system. Each

semester, I'll recruit 2-3 DKU students interested in community service, letting them shadow

project tasks (e.g., activity planning, resident communication) for 1-2 months. Before handover, I'll

hold a training session to walk them through the manual and key partnerships, ensuring the project

continues without disruption. This approach keeps the project rooted in resident needs while

guaranteeing long-term continuity.
