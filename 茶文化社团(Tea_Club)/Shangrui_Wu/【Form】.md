Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I am interested in the Daily Tea project because I want to improve my skills in project management

and execution. I am excited about the 'full project cycle' mentioned in the description, which lets

me practice everything from the first plan to the final event day. While I enjoy the 'New Chinese

Lifestyle' theme, my main goal is to learn how to turn a creative idea into a real, successful market.

I also look forward to collaborating with the DKU Tea Club. I believe this experience will help me

become better at organizing complex events and working with different teams to make sure

everything runs smoothly.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

Two main experiences make me a strong community leader. First, as the Student Council President

in high school, I learned how to lead teams and organize large events. I am good at communicating

with people and solving problems under pressure.|Second, I have strong analytical skills. In my

STATS102 class, I received the highest score for my research on Donald Trump's speeches. This

shows I can handle complex data and think critically. I believe a good leader needs both

organizational skills and a rational mind. I will use these strengths to manage the project efficiently

and make smart, data-driven decisions.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

My plan for the project's long-term success relies on data-driven decision making. I have strong

analytical skills, demonstrated by my highest score in STATS102, where I conducted research on

Donald Trump's speeches.|I will apply this skill to design a feedback system for the market. By

collecting and analyzing visitor data, we can accurately understand what students and locals like.

This data will help future teams make smart adjustments, ensuring the 'Daily Tea' market stays

popular and sustainable for years to come.

Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of this project.

To ensure continuous progress, I will create a detailed 'Execution Playbook.' This document will

record every step of our work, from vendor contacts to safety rules. This way, future teams can

easily learn from our experience without starting from scratch.|To manage leader transitions, I will

draw on my experience as Student Council President. I know how important it is to pass on

knowledge clearly. My 'Playbook' will serve as a guide to make the transition smooth for new

leaders.|Finally, regarding collaboration, I will maintain close communication with the project leader.

I will actively report my progress and ensure my work aligns with the leader's vision. I believe that

supporting the project leader with clear updates is key to a successful and efficient team.
