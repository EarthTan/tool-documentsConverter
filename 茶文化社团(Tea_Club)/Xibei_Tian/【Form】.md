Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

I am very interested in joining this tea club project mainly because of my personal love for tea and

some hands-on experience I already have. My interest started when I took the Mediart 101 course

last semester. For a class project, I shot a short documentary about a local tea house. During

filming, I had the chance to talk a lot with the shop owner. She taught me about different types of

tea and showed me the proper ways to brew each one. This first-hand experience made me

appreciate tea culture much more-it's not just a drink, but an art and a tradition.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

My experience as Secretary of the DKU Bakery Club has given me direct leadership skills in

organization, communication, and event planning. I learned how to manage activities and work

within a team to create engaging activities. Furthermore, creating a documentary in Mediart 101

required initiative, interpersonal skills, and active listening to connect with and represent a

community member's story. I believe leadership is about facilitating an inclusive environment, and I

am eager to apply these practical skills to help build and serve a shared community around tea.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

I consistently use a detailed daily planner for time-blocking and task management, which is a key

strength I will apply to ensure the long-term development of the Tea Culture Club. |This structured

approach enables effective project management. I will first establish a clear activity calendar and

mark the deadline of each task. Second, I will stay in touch with the project contact person and

update the progress on time.
