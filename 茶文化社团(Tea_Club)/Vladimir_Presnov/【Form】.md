Why are you interested in this project/field/industry?

Before joining DKU, I first encountered Chinese tea as a small gift from my mother when we went to

a Chinese tea cafe and got a real experience. This is when I purchased my first tea set, and learned

the word ""gaiwan"" or ""chaban."" My experience with tea was very basic and superficial until I

started travelling around China's most prominent tea regions like Fujian, Yunnan, and Jiangsu. My

tastes started to develop, I could distinguish ""xiaozhong"" tea from simple ""gongfucha."" This is

when I reorganized my room's windowstill to become a tea corner, and started do my own tea diary

with my favorite from around China, and from producers I met while travelling. Having my room full

of tea made me think like I could start inviting people over which was very successful. Later and up

until now, I have made a group chat with students who regularly come to drink tea on Saturdays at

12pm and learn about a new unique factory or a new tea type I brought to try.

Describe the experience and skills that make you a good community leader.

During my almost 4 out of 4.5 years at DKU, I have been a co-president and founder of a well-

known around campus Animal Protection Academy (APA) which grew to be a community on its own.

APA consists of a very diverse range of members: professors, students, graduate students, outside

vendors, and even university administration and staff. These members create a unique atmosphere

for animals and humans on campus all backed by the never-ending communications with

administration, veterinarians, staff, students on cats health condition, neutering another cat, raising

awareness on approaching cats and so on. The main skill here is to balance the ability to push until

end and leave some things as they are to keep the student organization afloat. As a part of DKU

community, which is true for other communities around the world, we have to balance between the

desires of many outside participants, institutions and our own vision. My approach to be firm in

pushing for making campus-wide rules, to keep schedules for feeding animals, or to communicate

with Operations resulted in a sustainable club which persisted over 4 years.

(For long-term projects) Describe your plan for sustaining the long-term development of

this project.

The main question which may arise with me applying for this project: who is going to continue it

after I graduate? Since the end of the project is in July 2026 and my graduation date is in

December 2026, I am able to finish the project within the required timeline. However, as a current

president of an unofficial Chinese tea club, I am thinking on how the project is to develop in further

semesters, Spring 2027 and beyond. In order to keep the project developing, I made a team from

diverse classes, 2027 and 2028, and from various backgrounds - internationals, ABCs, and

Mainland Chinese. Moreover, the concept of the club expects more members to join and get

engaged with the club's development - drinking tea, giving their own quick presentations of

favourite tea, do their own tea ceremony according to the rules. In addition to students, the

participating faculty, Prof. Lianyun Pang, is ready to support the club as an advisor and

representative from LCC and Humanities. The long-term development stands on the importance of

the club to the community and it being interlinked with various campus institutions.
